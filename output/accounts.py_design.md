This module defines the `Account` class which encapsulates the functionalities required by the account management system for a trading simulation platform. It includes methods that manage deposits, withdrawals, buying and selling shares, as well as reporting functionality for holdings and transactions. Additionally, a mock implementation of `get_share_price` is provided to simulate share price retrieval for AAPL, TSLA, and GOOGL.
